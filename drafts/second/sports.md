##MEN'S BASKETBALL 

When the Gators took on the Kentucky Wildcats at Rupp Arena on Febraruary 15, ESPN displayed before and after pictures of UF seniors Will Yeguete, Casey Prather and Patric Young. Each looked more pumped up than the next, with muscles so defined, you'd think that Michelangelo sculpted them himself. Those three men who were once lanky are now some of the strongest in the nation for college men’s basketball. All are a product of Preston Greene’s training programs. 

Greene, AGE, has been the team’s strength and conditioning coordinator for three seasons. Every day, year round, he’s with the team making them stronger, more flexible and faster than the day they were recruited. He’s the guy on the court before the game stretching the players out who all the girls wish they could be. Of all the individuals who help contribute to the performance of a UF men’s basketball player, Greene is, literally, the most hands on. 

This relationship begins when incoming freshmen enroll for Summer B. Throughout voluntary off-season training sessions, Greene begins to evaluate each player and creates a personal program for each player to fix what he calls their “weak link.” The way each player runs, how they condition, how they move on the court and what position they play are all taken into consideration. With each season, the training program is altered as the players grow and improve. After the season is over, Greene meets with Head Coach Billy Donovan and the coaching staff to set goals for each player. Optimal body weights are their focus. 

“I want my guys to be very,very lean,” Greene stressed, “because the leaner or less body fat they have, for basketball, the quicker they are and the higher they can jump. If a guy has, in my opinion, a higher body fat than I would like, then I will determine his body weight off of that. Or if a guy is already lean and he’s at the weight that I want." 

Will Yeguete, AGE, however, didn't have an introductory Preston session when he started at UF in 2010. With a different strength and conditioning coordinator on staff, the 6-foot-7 forward suffered injury after injury: concussions, a broken foot,and knee problems. In 2013, he underwent several arthroscopic surguries to remove bone chips in his right knee.  

DIFFERENT -- how his body changed post-injury 
Then ------ with Preston on staff, Will saw a drastic change in his body. 

"I learned so much more about my body -- how the stretching works, eating well," Yeguete said. "Preston knows a lot about the body, and he's good about sharing those things with us. He gives us a lot of advice about preparing our bodies for each season." 

"He's there every single day for us if we need anything." 

TRANSITION 

Greene compares the process to that of getting your car aligned. Just as you let go of your steering wheel to see what direction your car goes in, basketball players are the same way in the way they move on the court and in the weight room. 

"Guys may be quicker to their right than they are to their left," Greene explained. "They may be tighter in one muscle than another one that works synergistically with the other. They may be stronger in one part of the body versus another part of the body. Those ratios change throughout the season just because of the way they move, the way they play, injuries." 

After a head-to-toe breakdown on each guy of their tightest and weakest spots, Greene prescribes certain exercises, movements, sets and reps to align each player's steering wheel. 

Greene's role changes depending what time of year it is. After assessments in the pre-season, Greene said, “I am just smashing these guys physically and mentally each and every day without basically a whole lot of basketball involved." He meets with them in training groups made up of six groups of two players based on the goals of the players. During the season, once the basketball is in their hands again, Greene has to ease up, and training groups consolidate to three or four guys in a group. 

“Priority at that time is winning games, practicing and being ultra competitive on the court," Greene ----, "so I can’t do a whole lot with them during that time frame. If I am smashing them and killing those guys, then Coach Donovan is going to be pretty upset at me because we aren’t going to be our best come game time.” 

With the Gators having one of the best seasons in the team's history, Greene is ecstatic. His positive energy is a staple for the team, though -- win or lose. 

“One way I’ve been successful is I’m very, very energetic and very passionate about what we do," he ---, "so when my guys come in to train, they tend to feed off my energy. When they come in, I’m ready to go right off the bat.”


“They know from day one that there is a certain level of expectation that needs to be met on the court and in the weight room.” 

WILL QUOTE 


“I’m pretty fortunate to work for a very, very successful head coach. Coach Donovan can be pretty selective in who he recruits, so I am very fortunate where I have a really, really good group of guys who want to all win and want to accomplish their individual goals and our team goals and they all want to play professionally at some level, so right there off the bat, there is an internal motivation that these guys have, so that helps me.” 


“I have the support from Coach Donovan. He tells these guys during the recruiting process and during their time here, we are going to work in this program. You’re not just going to show up and play games. You are going to practice every day. You are going to condition. You are going to lift weights. You are going to do all these things in order to be successful, and that’s kind of the values of our program. Our program is based on hard work. They get this message from everybody.” 

Having been successful here, there is a level of expectation that this program is based off of national championships, Final Four appearances, and success of former Gator athletes in the National Basketball Association. 

"They see these guys come back and work and that really hits home with our young guys. It’s like, ‘Hey! OK, these guys are not just talented. They work to be successful.’” 

When they walk through the doors, he’s going to get it out of them no matter what is happening outside. 
	“You’re not leaving until we accomplish what I need to accomplish," Greene said.
