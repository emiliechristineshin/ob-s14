#Individual Story 


For my story, I plan to cover all nighters. I will look at coffee vs. energy drinks vs. other methods students have for staying awake/energized.  I still need to talk to experts.  I plan on talking to people from Gator Well


These are some of my notes based on some of the students I've spoken to.


The all nighter – a rite of passage of the college experience.
As hard as student might try to avoid staying up all night before a major exam, students still find themselves find themselves up during the early morning hours chugging caffeine to get themselves through the studying the need to get done.
Virginia Somers, a graduate student, said she had really bad study habits as an undergraduate student.
The 23-year-old veterinary medicine major said she avoided coffee because she hated the taste, but she would turn to Mountain Dew if she felt she needed the caffeine.  If she really needed to pull an all nighter, she would depend on 5-hour ENERGY to get her through the day.  
Somers said the energy drink did keep her awake for a full five hours, but she would always crash afterward.  She also did not like the taste, saying it was really sour and comparing it to fluoride and cough syrup.
Having learned from her mistakes as an undergraduate, Somers tries to have better study habits and take breaks to go to the gym to keep her energy up.
Eileen Estoque, 19, prefers coffee to energy drinks.  Estoque said she likes to have her coffee balanced between sweet with a little bit of bitterness.
Sarah Gaies, 20, doesn’t like caffeinated drinks to stay awake.  Gaies said she never acquired a taste for coffee and didn’t like the artificial taste of energy drinks, describing them as “plastic-y.”
Instead, the health science sophomore said she eats chocolate when she needs to stay awake.  She said the sugar helps, and she uses it as a reward system.
Gaies said she tries to not need all nighers, but they do sometimes happen.  The latest she’s stayed up until was 8:30 a.m. to write a paper.
