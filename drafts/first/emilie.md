Because my indiviudal story is completely visually, I'm working on it with the art directors but wanted to let other 
editors know that I do have an individual piece. I've taken headshots of about 10 individuals and asked them the question
"What do you get excited about?" (I think having excitment about something is a facet of having energy.) It is my vision 
that when the reader scrolls over each individual's headshot, their answer to the question will appear. When the reader 
scrolls off the image, the headshot will reappear. I've shown my InDesign file to the art directors and they've made some
suggestions. I plan to get more photos of individuals, and if enough, I'd like to do a pie graph categorizing the different 
answers. I'd be glad to show other editors my InDesign file in class (not sure how to upload in Github).
