##Lede
Beneath the “Parental Advisory” beanie and the rough, black hoodie, the 4 a.m. shadows conceal his coon-eye tan. Andrew Balasis turns the radio dial, drowning out the eerie silence that echoes through the nearly empty streets. The 23-year-old commercial fisherman rises before dawn most days, chasing the horizon in pursuit of fish. He has a feeling today’s trip will be futile.
