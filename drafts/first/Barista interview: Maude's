BARISTA INTERVIEW: Maude’s 


Meet the barista who has been there from the start. 

Layne Wrighton, 26, has made her contribution to Maude’s since the age of 9, even if it meant having towel-folding competitions with her sister. Her father, Maude’s Owner Matthew Wrighton, opened the coffee shop about 19 years ago. 

“It was really fun watching it build,” she said. 

One of Gainesville’s oldest coffee shops, Maude’s Classic Café provides its customers with not only a steady food, drink and dessert menu, but also with inside and patio seating, board games and a lively atmosphere.

It’s a place where regulars thrive and strangers are soon to become regulars. 

Wrighton started officially working at Maude’s about six years ago, first hosting, then serving and then working the register. She later became a barista while getting trained to bake, which is something that she has always wanted to do. When Maude’s expanded its food menu, Wrighton helped create the newest additions and revamped a lot of the baking options.

“I’ve always enjoyed baking and food, so food is probably my number one interest,” she said. 
“I’m always making coffee. I’m always the barista.  I’m always the registered person. Sometimes, I get to do baking or make a food order, which I really like. For making coffee, I’ve gotten really good at my foam now, so I’m really excited about dabbling in foam art.”

When she’s not a barista or baker, she’s an artist, volunteering as a seamstress and doing costume design. 
“I do costumes for myself and then I did an art show for a friend of mine. She directs plays and she asked me to do the costumes for a play that she did. This is kind of my community service but also my art outlet as well,” she said.  

Other than artistic passions, Wirghton loves reading books.

“I actually just got done reading Harry Potter,” she said. “This is like the fourth time. I’m just reverting back to childhood—going back and remembering all those great books I read as a kid.”

Wrighton also works at Amelia’s, the Italian restaurant behind the Hippodrome, making desserts.
 “That’s my savings account job, basically. There’s definitely a difference between working there and here. Here’s a little bit more involved. I deal with customers and just working with other people. Over there, I’m by myself.”

Q: What inspires you?
A: “Good-tasting food. I’m a bit of a people-pleaser, so definitely making a customer happy, doing foam art, having fun while I’m here.”

Q: Why Maude’s? What makes it different?
A: “I’ve had some opportunities to get jobs at other places, and I’ve been here for six years now, so there’s definitely motivation to hang on, and part of that is definitely my dad and that our relationship has been able to grow since working together. He’s very easy to work for and with.” 

“The way we do the hiring here is that the employees hire, so you’re always able to choose the people you want to work with. Everybody hangs out outside of Maude’s and everybody does enjoy each other’s company when we are here. Nobody has gotten into any fights.” 

“We’re able to have influence.” Matthew wants employees to have their own artistic influence. We should want to do things. He doesn’t want to have to make us do things.”

Q: What’s the best part about working at Maude’s?
A: “Getting to do specials, coming up with really awesome soups, just being able to do new creative stuff all the time and really push my limits as a baker. Our core menu stays the same, but we always have specials going.  We do a lot of gluten-free specials.” 

Q: What’s the worst part about working at Maude’s?
A: “I think the worst part if having to trespass people and having to ask people to leave. Normally, that involves very drunk and/or homeless people getting aggressive. I don’t want to do it, and it just makes me anxious.” 

Q: It’s a customer’s first time. What do you recommend? 
A: “I’ll usually recommend the special we have going, which changes every few days depending on how well it’s selling, or I’ll just suggest a regular cup of coffee. The Maude’s iced coffee is our signature iced coffee and that’s really good. We’re doing the dark chocolate cherry latte right now, which is one that I came up with.”

Q: What’s the most popular drink?
A: “Our black iced coffee or just a regular cup of coffee. A lot of chai teas.” 

Q: When you’re hyped on coffee, you…
A: “When I’m hyped up on coffee, I usually start stalking everything, cleaning, and usually chatting up customers way too much. I get silly—and I get really efficient.”  

Q: What’s a normal day like at Maude’s?
A: “The early mornings are not super busy. We usually have one or two people coming in, so we can do baking and stuff.  Once it gets closer to 11, we have a lot more people coming in for breakfast as well as lunch. Definitely afternoons have been a lot busier lately where people are ordering lunch. It definitely always slows down once it gets closer to 5 or 6 p.m., because we still serve food into the evening, but it’s not really a dinner menu. We have people coming in at night on dates and coming in to study. So, the nights are a little bit slower overall compared to the daytime. We usually end up closing the food kitchen between 7 and 8 p.m. because nobody’s ordering anything.”

Wrighton said group dates and double dating are really popular. She said she has noticed a lot of people doing online meets and blind dates at Maude’s. 
“I think it’s a really big place for that, which I find really endearing because it means that they trust us,” she said. “They feel like this is a comfortable place for them to come, and that’s really awesome.”

Q: What is the ratio of regulars vs. first-timers?
A: “Regulars come in every day. There are maybe like 10 to 20 regulars that I see every time I’m here, maybe even more than that. More than anything, the regulars keep us afloat, but I’ve noticed over the last year, we’ve had a lot more people here for the first time. Now, I feel like it’s become even. It’s always fun when people come in and they’re showing someone else around like it’s their first time.”

Q: Is this your go-to coffee shop when you’re not working? 
A: “Oh yeah, for sure. I’ve actually been wanting to try out the coffee shop that they have in the CMC because a couple of my friends work there, but it’s such a habit to just come here first. There’s always somebody sitting outside that I know or I’m friends with.”

Q: If you had to describe this coffee shop in one word, what would it be?
A: “Soul. It’s got soul. For a while, I thought we had ghosts here, so there might actually be some souls here…”

Q: What’s something most people don’t know about Maude’s?
A: “Usually that it used to be at the Big Lou’s location. A lot of people are surprised by that, even if they’ve been coming here forever. I don’t think anybody knows the owner [Matthew Wrighton] used to be a DJ for 10 years.” 

Q: Any other comments about Maude’s? 
A: “Well, we’re talking about expanding. I’m really excited about that, and it means I get to dive further into the menu and expand the menu and bring some tapas, so, we’re about to do some revamping. I really hope that it brings even more people in. The place next door emptied out, so we’re talking about knocking down parts of walls and opening up the front windows again. I’m hoping to do more specialty cake orders with the expansion and more baking and be able to eventually make our own bread—at least start making gluten-free bread so we have a gluten-free option. It’s in the planning stage right now.”
