# Mr. Positive Push 

## By: Devon Abelman 


Everyone has their own definition of rock bottom. Some people know it just in case -- almost as a measure. Some people know it when they feel it. It could be losing your job, going bankrupt, breaking up with a significant other, eating the whole carton of ice cream. For Brody Stevens, it was lying in a hospital bed. 

He didn't get in an accident. Nothing had to be operated on. No apparent injuries could be seen on his body. But there he was lying in a hospital bed in UCLA. But this wasn't the intensive care unit. This was the psych ward, and no one was more in shock than Brody himself. 

"I never, ever, ever thought I would end up in a hospital, never," he remarked in a phone interview. "I didn’t even know that kind of stuff happened." 

Rock bottom was trying to pass off his mania as performance act and everyone believing it was all part of his act until guns where metioned. Rock bottom was getting detained by police after getting out of the shower. 

Before everything spiraled downward, life for Brody Stevens seemed like the exact opposite of rock bottom. He wasn't just an audience warm up comedian anymore. Instead he was a guy about to have his own show on HBO. TMZ just hired him to be a host. His comedy was taking him to festivals all around the country and even to Ireland. His career was pointing upwards. 

“I was on a streak," Brody revealed. "I was on a hot streak, and I was feeling good."

The 43-year-old, born Steven Brody, grappled with anxiety for --- years before going on medication to control it. But in 2011, medication no longer seemed necessary to him. Stopping abruptly sent Brody's hot streak into a total meltdown, and everyone knew about it. His manic episode was out in the world for everyone to see with the help of Twitter and viral videos. In his own words, he was going nuts. EXAMPLES 

His friend, actor Zach Galifianakis, stepped in after getting strange voicemails from his friend.

Zach was also the driving force behind Brody's new HBO show. For years, Zach told Brody that he was interested in doing a show about him. 

“He always thought it was funny the way I interacted with my sister," Brody explained, "and he thought my mind was kind of interesting." 

So they taped a pilot. The documentary-style show's focus was on Brody and his sister, Stephanie, reconciling for his mom's 80th birthday. Later Zach and Brody pitched it to Comedy Central, HBO and Adult Swim, and all the networks liked it. HBO eventually ordered five more episodes, giving Brody two months to plan before taping. 

However, in these two months, he ended up in that hospital bed and the focus of the show shifted. Seventeen days in the psych ward was not enough to take the show away from him or his motivation. 

"My friends are saying it’s like kind of rock 'n' roll. It’s kind of funny," Brody recounts with levity, spinning his rock bottom into something more glamourous and hardcore than his actual diagnonis. "It’s not funny, but it is a little bit. Nobody got hurt. It could have been bad. But that’s when they kind of started putting it in my head." 

Sitting in bed, he starting mapping out his new vision for the show. His goal for those first five episodes HBO ordered was basic.  

“I wanted to go from the hospital to doing stand up on TV," Brody explained, giving himself a clear beginning and end to achieve. "That would be a big leap.” 

He felt having this goal was realistic and smart. Instead of gunning for a nationwide tour or starring on a sitcom, he had his eyes on Conan. With this in mind, he started brainstorming the steps he would have to get to achieve his goal. EXAMPLES By the time he was discharged, he basically wrote the first six episodes with a focus on him going from mania to being on TV. (repetitive?) 

The second six were focused on Brody coming out of depression after starting to feel like himself again and doing Conan with a warm reception. 

"I didn’t really see it coming," Brody recalled. "It was bad. It was a number of factors that went into that: medication, moving to Hollywood. It really threw me for a loop. So my thing was why don’t we make it going from depression to doing my half hour special. Instead of doing Conan, now I’ve raised the stakes." 

TRANSITION 

Being an inspiration to others was never his intention. He said he never went out of his way to do so. "I never said this is going to inspire people, this is going to change the world. This needs to be said. I need to make a public service announcement." While he was glad he was an inspiration for some, his focus was on his comedy. 

“It was more about me being honest and being funny. I wanted to be funny, and I wanted to be real. Funny and real."


The most feedback is about mental issues, family members being sick and anger issues. He had no idea his story would effect others. What strikes viewers most is his positive energy despite his obstacles. During his sets, he exclaims his little catchphrases like "Enjoy it!" "Push and believe." It's his way of keeping the audience engaged -- not to INSPIRE others. 

His focus on positive energy started in college. While playing baseball at Arizona State University, he learned about visualization and positive thoughts. As an athlete, he learned you can't blame others, life is unfair, and it's not healthy to be negative. After graduating, he moved to Seattle where he did public-access TV show with Teina Manu, a -------. 

"He taught me, ‘Hey! Be nice! Be happy!” So that kind of, not validated, maybe it did, my college thing. I just applied what I had learned in college into comedy and what I learned in baseball, then it took someone to be like, ‘Hey! I’m like that, too.’ I started being positive." 

Having that positive energy was crucial to his recovery after his stint in the psych ward. Knowing it helped him in the past, he knew had to focus on the positive to help him recover. However, now it was no longer part of his act.

"I kind of had to get myself out of this hole. It wasn’t like, 'Oh, I’m a nice guy, positive energy.' I really needed positive energy to get me out of the hole. I just learned that by generating that energy that good stuff can happen. Good things started to happen. I put certain emotions out in the universe, and good things happened again.” 

Don't expect Brody to put Mr. Positive Energy under his name on his business card any time soon, though. 
"Being positive is never going to go out of style. It’s never going to be wrong. So me as a performer, I don’t have to label myself like that," he noted. Instead, he's rather Mr. Postive Push because he thinks that's funnier and a new spin on the term that people seem to throw around a lot. 
"As a comedian, I like to keep it fresh, so now I’m more into Positive Push."
