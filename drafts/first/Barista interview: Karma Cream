BARISTA INTERVIEW: Karma Cream

Its name fits its purpose. 

With a drive to use solely organic ingredients and provide vegan-friendly options to customers, Kyle Fick, 29-year-old owner of Karma Cream, said he opened it with the intention of starting a business that was cruelty-free and socially responsible. 

“Everything here is organic—our milk—it’s all grass-fed, hormone-free treated cows. My wife, she’s vegan. I’m vegetarian myself.  So there was kind of a purpose to this as well than just making money and scooping ice-cream. This is kind of a means to the end. I’d rather have an option that people might feel better about.”

And that’s how he came up with the name, Karma Cream. 

After graduating with a political science degree at the University of Florida, Fick started working in restaurants and sales and making music before deciding he wanted to do something on his own. “I kind of from early on didn’t want to work for anyone else and wanted to play by my own rules,” he said. “So far it’s working out.”

Fick has been the owner for almost five years, since Karma Cream opened in April 2009 on West University Avenue. Meet the barista, a UF alumnus, Kyle Fick:


Q: What inspires you? 
A: I play guitar. I’m in a local band called Sunshine State. We like to jam out. We go out of town a lot.

Q: Why Karma Cream? What makes it different?
A: We are committed to sourcing everything [as] organic as possible. For one, it’s much better for the planet. It’s much better for harvesters. It’s much better for the animals. Plus, you go out and get a coffee or latte and there’s a big mark-up there. It’s very cheap to brew a cup of coffee, so why not make sure it’s the best? You go to a restaurant and usually it’s a terrible ingredient and they make 20 bucks for a plate—something you can make at home with better ingredients. I kind of felt the logic behind marking up something that.

Q: What’s the best part about working at Karma Cream?
A: I love when people are just so happy with what they get here. We have a lot of people who are vegan or lack-toast intolerant, and the fact that they can eat things that they could never eat. To make people genuinely happy—I mean, that’s something that you expect from a kid—but grown people that are just so happy, that’s such an awesome thing to be a part of.”

Q: What’s the worst part about working at Karma Cream?
A: Just the responsibilities of being an owner; to try and juggle the responsibilities of working here all the time to taking care of all the back-end things as well—wearing a lot of different hats. It’s a challenge for sure, but it’s working out.

Q: It’s a customer’s first time. What do you recommend? 
A: I first ask what you’re here for. We have ice cream. At least 50% of our sales are ice cream and the rest is our date stuff or coffee. I think our ice cream is amazing. It’s organic, and we can even combine two with ice cream floats. So, we can get weird with it, for sure.

Q: What do you recommend out of the coffee options?  
A: I recommend an almond milk latte. A lot of people want something different than dairy or want something different than soy. I like to keep it classic: a shot of espresso with some milk.

Q: What’s the most popular drink? 
A: The special right now, the Lavender Earl Grey Latte. We’ve been trying to add a lot of new things. We change the specials about once a month. We might change a special into a main item. A lot of it is just employee ideas; they just experiment. 

Q: When you’re hyped on coffee, you…?
A:I actually don’t drink much coffee for that reason. I’ve always been pretty high-energy myself. When I drink coffee, I’m pumped. I’ll be running all over the place. I can do anything. It’s like a drug.

Q: What’s a normal day like at Karma Cream?
A: In the mornings, it’s pretty slow, and I’ll get things open and I’ll start baking cupcakes, baking croissants. We make vegan croissants as well. That’s a new thing that’s come out that ‘s been very popular. We get a rush around lunch. We do have some sandwich options that are vegan-friendly, so people come here and guarantee they’ll get something vegan. It stays pretty steady until about 7 or 8 p.m. when we get the evening ice cream crowd and studiers. A lot of studiers come out. We have free Wi-Fi. We’ll stay pretty busy till late in that night. That’s why we close at 1:30 a.m. A lot of cafes close at like 7 or 8 p.m. We used to be open until 3 a.. We tried 24 hours for a bit.

Q: What is the ratio of people who study alone to people on dates or with friends: 
A: 50/50. Every day, all day, at a table, you’ve got someone studying or hanging out and studying. Everyone’s doing something now on their iPhone  or iPad.

Q: What’s the weirdest thing that has happened at Karma Cream?
A: Homeless people hanging around, but we don’t get too much of that. It could be worse.

Q: What is the ratio of regulars to first-timers?
A: We have dailies and we have a lot of first-timers. If someone doesn’t look familiar, I’ll ask if they’ve been here before. There are new people every day. I’d say we get more regulars, and then first-timers become regulars. It’s the circle of life.

Q: Is this your go-to coffee shop when you’re not working? 
A: “This is definitely it. There will be other baristas who come here too [from other coffee shops], which is weird; I mean, this is the go-to place. I’m pretty proud of that. I don’t know of other places that do organic milk off the top of my head. That’s a huge deal.”

Q: If you had to describe this coffee shop in one word, what would it be?
A: I’d say karma. That’s kind of why we named it. It was an alliteration, so that’s always a go-to. I’m not a Buddhist or Hindu, but definitely when I think of karma—realizing where and how you get products—you definitely have that purpose in mind that you know you put good karma back out there. It’s on the more personal side of things. I think people appreciate that. Every ingredient I source, I make sure it’s organic. I cherry-pick from a lot of places.

Q: What’s something most people don’t know about Karma Cream?
A: We have fair trade. It took a year to open, which is a terrible thing. It was a smoke shop. It was a complete wreck in here. Everything was tore up. It wasn’t intended to be a café. It was kind of a weird set-up. We had to do lot of work to get this place to make any kind of sense. It’d definitely small. We’ve outgrown it, so we do our best to meet the demand. We certainly need more space. I try to be pretty conservative. It’s best to work with what you have until you’re 100 percent sure you’ve outgrown it. In the meantime, you should play it safe and don’t mess with the formula.


Fick said he never thought he would become an owner of a coffee shop.
“I’d never had a business before. I’m very fortunate and lucky that this has worked out really well—to make a living at least.”
Fick said his intention from the start was to focus on selling ice cream and coffee. “We see coffee grow a lot and we have to do a lot with very little amount of space,” he said. “We can get backed up pretty easy on a busy day just because demand is definitely going up since we opened.”
