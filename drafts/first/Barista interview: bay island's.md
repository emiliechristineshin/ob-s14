Bay Island’s Barista Interview

Name: Jayme Brockman
Age: 31
Tell me a little bit about yourself:
What do you wanna know? You have to be a little more specific.
Where are you from? 
South Florida
And what do you do here at Bay Island’s?
I’m the General Manager.
How long have you worked here?
For almost 2 years.
Why Bay Island? What makes it different?
Because we’ve got the best stuff in town. We’ve got the best ingredients, and we order in small quantities so everything is fresh.
What’s your best part about working at Bay Island?
It’s definitely the customer interaction. Here it’s all about knowing peoples names because, you know, we have a small team. It’s only about four of us. And we all have a different routine and coffee-making smile, but we all try to make people happy.
What’s the worst part about working at Maude’s?
I have to say it’s the time. Waking up early so we can open by seven isn’t fun. Especially after Superbowl Sunday. 
It’s a customer’s first time. What do you recommend? 
It depends on what they want. If you want a hot drink i’d recommend either a cup of coffee - we have different coffee beans from all over the world every month - or a mocha latte because everyone likes chocolate. You can’t go wrong with that. If you want an iced drink, get a caramel latte - that’s my favorite. But if you want frozen, then the frozen cappuccino is the way to go. 
What’s the most popular drink?
The iced coffee in any flavor. Some people get it with coffee ice cubes so when the ice melts in doesn’t become watery.
When I’m hyped on coffee, I ...
Work faster. I probably have one or two cups of coffee depending on how long i’m working. But I always have at least one.  
What’s a normal day like at Bayl Island?
I mean, It’s nothing that’s always the same. I make coffee. People order different things. During the weekend we get more food orders and more students.  
What’s the weirdest thing that has happened at Bay Island?
I just get weird orders. One person gets a raspberry-coconut smoothie. It just seems like a weird combination but it’s actually pretty good.
-Regulars vs. first-timers?
The regulars know. Some will switch up their drinks but there are regulars always get the same thing. I know what they’re getting and I can pre-make it. The first-timers don’t really branch out in the menu. 
-Is this your go-to coffee shop when you’re not working? 
For sure. Unless i’m out of town. But if i’m in town this is the only place I visit. 
If you had to describe this coffee shop in one word, what would it be?
Excellent. I mean... we’re pretty awesome. 
What’s something most people don’t know about Bay Island?
That we’re here, I mean... We’re pretty small. But other than that I would say some our menu options. We have a pretty big menu for such a tiny place. For example, not many people order our milkshakes. We also have a few off-menu items like a the Differccino, which is an iced cappuccino with two different syrup combinations - I like combining white chocolate and sugar-free hazelnut. We also have the Bay Island Shake, which is a combination between a smoothie and a milkshake.
