Bay Island’s Barista Interview

Name: Jayme Brockman
Age: 31
Tell me a little bit about yourself:
What do you wanna know? You have to be a little more specific.
Where are you from? 
South Florida
And what do you do here at Bay Island’s?
I’m the General Manager.
How long have you worked here?
For almost 2 years.


Q: Why Bay Island? What makes it different?
A: Because we’ve got the best stuff in town. We’ve got the best ingredients, and we order in small quantities so everything is fresh.

Q: What’s the best part about working at Bay Island?
A: It’s definitely the customer interaction. Here it’s all about knowing peoples names because, you know, we have a small team. It’s only about four of us. And we all have a different routine and coffee-making smile, but we all try to make people happy.

Q: What’s the worst part about working at Maude’s?
A: I have to say it’s the time. Waking up early so we can open by seven isn’t fun. Especially after Superbowl Sunday. 
Q: It’s a customer’s first time. What do you recommend? 
A: It depends on what they want. If you want a hot drink i’d recommend either a cup of coffee - we have different coffee beans from all over the world every month - or a mocha latte because everyone likes chocolate. You can’t go wrong with that. If you want an iced drink, get a caramel latte - that’s my favorite. But if you want frozen, then the frozen cappuccino is the way to go. 

Q: What’s the most popular drink?
A: The iced coffee in any flavor. Some people get it with coffee ice cubes so when the ice melts in doesn’t become watery.

Q: When I’m hyped on coffee, I ...
A: Work faster. I probably have one or two cups of coffee depending on how long i’m working. But I always have at least one.  

Q: What’s a normal day like at Bayl Island?
A: I mean, It’s nothing that’s always the same. I make coffee. People order different things. During the weekend we get more food orders and more students.  

Q: What’s the weirdest thing that has happened at Bay Island?
A: I just get weird orders. One person gets a raspberry-coconut smoothie. It just seems like a weird combination but it’s actually pretty good.

Q: Regulars vs. first-timers?
A: The regulars know. Some will switch up their drinks but there are regulars always get the same thing. I know what they’re getting and I can pre-make it. The first-timers don’t really branch out in the menu. 

Q: Is this your go-to coffee shop when you’re not working? 
A: For sure. Unless i’m out of town. But if i’m in town this is the only place I visit. 

Q: If you had to describe this coffee shop in one word, what would it be?
A: Excellent. I mean... we’re pretty awesome. 

Q: What’s something most people don’t know about Bay Island?
A: That we’re here, I mean... We’re pretty small. But other than that I would say some our menu options. We have a pretty big menu for such a tiny place. For example, not many people order our milkshakes. We also have a few off-menu items like a the Differccino, which is an iced cappuccino with two different syrup combinations - I like combining white chocolate and sugar-free hazelnut. We also have the Bay Island Shake, which is a combination between a smoothie and a milkshake.
